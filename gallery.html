    <h1 style="color:chocolate;"><u>Gallery</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 120%;">A gallery is a physical space or online platform that is designed to showcase and display various types of artwork, such as paintings, sculptures, photographs, or installations. Galleries can be private or public and are typically managed by curators or gallery owners who select and present artwork for exhibition.

        In a physical gallery, visitors can walk through the space and view the artwork on display. Artwork is often hung on walls or displayed on pedestals, and the lighting and layout of the space are carefully curated to enhance the viewing experience. Many galleries also host opening receptions or events where visitors can meet the artists and discuss their work.
        
        In an online gallery, artwork is displayed digitally and can be viewed from anywhere with an internet connection. Online galleries may feature high-quality images of artwork along with descriptions and details about the artists and their work. Some online galleries also offer the ability to purchase artwork directly through the website.
        
        Overall, galleries provide a platform for artists to showcase their work and for audiences to engage with and appreciate art in a curated and meaningful way.</p>
